# heat_transfer_on_plate
The following code is written in Python usin Matplotlib and NumPy libraries. It shows a plot of temperature propagation on abstract 2d plate of size (m x n), the material of the plate is not taken into account(could be improved).

m - number of rows

n - number of columns

top, bottom, left, right - initial temperature values for every side of the plate


example values and plot for them:


m = 40

n = 40

#############

top = 200

bottom = 150

left = 100

right = 50
